I am particularly focused on iOS development, but I am open to all other opportunities as well. If you are interested in hiring me, you can contact me at <code>mail @ this domain</code> and I can send you my resume. Thank you!</p><h2>Loopover</h2><p>Loopover is a 2D puzzle game for iOS devices. You can view more about it on my <a href="/projects">projects</a> page. Current development is focusing on a statistics page that lets you view averages for recent solves for time and number of moves. I am also looking into support for GameKit leaderboards and achievements. I would also like to add animations for moves to make the game feel a bit more fluid and responsive.</p><h2>Lexel</h2><p>Lexel is a spaced-repetition based language learning app that lets you learn by reading what you care about. It is currently in progress. Current development is focused on implementing spaced-repetition for vocabulary words, and working on improving performance.</p><div></div></div></div><footer><p>© enzo 20XX • last modified 8/12/2024</p></footer></body></html>
